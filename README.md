# Amazon-bestsellers-books
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of bestselling books in Amazon between 2009 and 2019. The dataset contains columns such as 'Name', 'Author', 'User Rating', 'Reviews', 'Price', 'Year', and 'Genre'. Using Python, the project explores various insights including the distribution of user ratings, top authors by the number of bestsellers, genre comparison, price analysis, reviews vs. ratings, and price distribution.

The aim of this project is to gain insights into the bestselling books dataset and understand factors that contribute to a book's success. The analysis includes the following insights:

1. Distribution of User Ratings:
This analysis examines the distribution of user ratings given to the bestselling books. It helps evaluate the overall satisfaction level of readers and identify any trends or patterns in the ratings.

2. Top Authors by Number of Bestsellers:
This analysis identifies the authors who have the highest number of books in the bestselling list. It helps understand the popularity and success of different authors in the book market.

3. Genre Comparison:
This analysis compares the performance of different genres in the bestselling books dataset. It helps identify the most popular genres and analyze any preferences or trends related to genres.

4. Price Analysis:
This analysis explores the pricing patterns of the bestselling books. It helps understand the range of prices and identify any relationships between price and other factors such as ratings or genre.

5. Reviews vs. Ratings:
This analysis investigates the relationship between the number of reviews and user ratings. It helps determine if there is any correlation between the popularity of a book (measured by the number of reviews) and the satisfaction level of readers (measured by ratings).

6. Price Distribution:
This analysis examines the distribution of prices among the bestselling books. It helps identify the price ranges that are most common and understand the pricing strategies in the book market.

The Python code used to perform these analyses can be found in the project's repository. The code utilizes the Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis, as well as other libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
